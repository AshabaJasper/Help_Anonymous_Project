## Project Overview
We have chosen to embark on the project titled "Help Anonymous." This innovative platform is intricately aligned with two of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

1. **Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3):**  
   With our flagship feature of anonymous peer-to-peer chat, we aim to foster a supportive environment where individuals can freely share and receive feedback on their mental and emotional concerns. The self-assessment tools further empower users to understand and take charge of their mental well-being, pushing the boundaries of traditional mental health platforms.

2. **Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10):**  
   By making this platform accessible to all, and enriched with educational content on mental health, "Help Anonymous" seeks to democratize access to mental health insights and support, reducing disparities in knowledge and resource availability.

Our unwavering focus on these two SDGs drives our mission: to profoundly impact individual mental well-being while championing broader societal access to essential mental health resources.
